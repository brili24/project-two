      <h2>The quest for energy in a changing USA</h2>
      <p>Energy makes America go.</p>
      <p>
        But the way we get it is more complex and vulnerable than most of us
        realize.
      </p>
      <p>The truth about energy is that change won't come easily.</p>
      <p>
        Here, you can explore Americaâ€™s energy stories, meet the people behind
        the debate and join the conversation about our future.

      <h3>Coal</h3>
      <p>
        The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
        smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
        proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
        electricity.

      <h4>Wind</h4>
      <p>
        Once considered a burden, the wind is now reviving the Texas town of
        Roscoe by creating new jobs and bringing people back, giving a second
        chance to this once-dying community.
