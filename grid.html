          The U.S. energy grid is in trouble. The crumbling infrastructure and
          lag in construction of power lines have set the stage for more serious
          and frequent blackouts in the coming years.

      <h2>Smart Grid could re-energize an aging system</h2>
      <h3 id="author">By Courtney Woo</h3>
      <p>
        At 5 p.m. after a long day’s work, you drive your plug-in electric car
        to your garage. The car’s battery is fairly full because you drove
        little today. You plug your car into a charging station, but rather than
        recharge, you de-charge, pumping excess energy back into the power grid
        system and helping meet peak energy demand.
        <br /><br />
        “It’s like the Internet,” says Dr. Alex Huang, an electrical engineering
        professor at North Carolina State University, “but rather than share
        bits of information—such as Twitter messages and YouTube links—you share
        electrons.”
        <br /><br />
        Sharing energy is just one use of what has been dubbed the Smart Grid, a
        leaner, more intelligent version of the existing grid. As envisioned, it
        would use information technology and two-way digital communications to
        increase grid productivity, diagnose and treat its own problems, and
        allow consumers to better manage their energy use.
        <br /><br />
        Experts claim this technology will save money for both consumers and
        utilities and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of
        Energy, for example, estimates that increasing the grid’s efficiency by
        5 percent would be the equivalent of removing 53 million cars from the
        road. But some observers note the high cost of equipment to operate a
        smart grid system could short-circuit the effort.
        <br /><br />
        The way the grid stands now, utilities transmit power whenever a user
        flips a switch. Companies cannot monitor where the energy actually goes
        or where it is lost along the lines. During peak hours, companies meet
        demand by using backup “peaker plants,” such as coal-fired power plants,
        or by buying energy on the stock market. The expense eventually is
        passed to the consumer, and because the backup system generally relies
        on dirtier generation methods, it produces more carbon.
        <br /><br />
        Homes with smart meters connected to the Smart Grid could help to reduce
        lost power and save money. For example, a consumer could program his or
        her air-conditioning system to raise the thermostat in warm weather when
        demand for air conditioning rises or prices are high.
        <br /><br />
        The Smart Grid could also increase access to distributed generation, or
        on-site renewable energy sources. Huang envisions intelligent homes
        equipped with small-scale solar generation units that could feed a large
        battery located at the edge of town.
        <br /><br />
        “When demand is high, it’s more economical to use energy stored in a
        battery rather than turn on a coal-fired power plant,” Huang says. In
        addition to his work at North Carolina State University, Huang directs
        the National Science Foundation’s FREEDM Systems Center, which is
        developing Smart Grid components capable of storing and distributing
        renewable energy.
        <br /><br />
        These transitions will not happen overnight.

        <p>
          The Department of Energy would like to see a comprehensive national
          Smart Grid by 2030. In northern Kentucky and parts of Ohio, Duke
          Energy, the nation’s third largest electric utility, will install
          700,000 electric smart meters and 450,000 natural gas smart meters
          during the next five to seven years. The installation will cover 84
          percent of Duke Energy’s utility customers in these two states.
          <br /><br />
          Developing this system is also costly. Although Duke Energy has
          allocated $1 billion for hardware installation in Ohio, Indiana and
          the Carolinas over five years, these funds "won’t build our entire
          service area,” says Paige Layne, the marketing communications manager
          for Smart Grid technology at Duke Energy.
          <br /><br />
          The future cost to consumers will vary by state. In Ohio, for example,
          consumer rates increased 50 cents per month this year and will
          increase by $1.50 in 2010. But since customers will be better able to
          manage their consumption with Smart Grid technology, the bills will go
          down, says David Mohler, vice president and chief technology officer
          for Duke Energy. Last year, 35 participants in a pilot study in
          Cincinnati reduced their consumption by 10 to 20 percent.
          <br /><br />
          The biggest challenge is battery technology, Mohler says. Vehicle
          batteries require a carrying capacity thousands of times that of a
          cell phone battery. Engineers have yet to develop one that is both
          cheap and reliable.
          <br /><br />
          Still, pilot projects provide a glimpse of the future.
          <br /><br />
          Xcel Energy aims to make Boulder, Colo., the first “smart” city by the
          end of 2009. And Duke Energy has already launched a self-healing grid
          in Hendersonville, N.C. When a tree fell on Duke Energy lines in June
          2009, a nearby network station sensed and isolated the problem area.
          The station sent an automatic SOS to Duke Energy, quarantined the
          outage, and rerouted power to affected homes and businesses in a
          matter of seconds.
          <br /><br />
          Without this intelligence, homeowners must report disruptions to the
          power company. Then a team of linemen rides the lines—through forests
          and up mountains with flashlights if necessary—to locate the injury.
          In the Hendersonville case, an additional 1,500 customers would have
          lost power.
          <br /><br />
          “With Smart Grid, you don’t have to worry,” says Huang, “because
          software and communication take over.”
          <br /><br />
          But developing a Smart Grid system alone will not solve all the
          problems of the existing grid or eliminate the need for additional
          power lines to acquire electricity from renewable resources, Mohler
          says. “Ultimately, we need to do both.”
