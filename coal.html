      <h1>Debating coal’s future</h1>
      <p>
        The residents of Meigs County, Ohio, live beneath the towering
        smokestacks of four coal-fired power plants. A fifth plant has been
        proposed, the latest salvo in a battle over the way the U.S. gets
        electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2001, U.S. energy companies have proposed more than 150 new coal
        plants. But a loose network of environmental activists, aided by
        uncertain economic conditions, has forced plans for more than 100 of the
        plants to be abandoned. Dozens more are clogged up in the court systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One such coal fight is unfolding in Meigs County, Ohio, which is already
        surrounded by four coal-fired power plants.
        <a href="http://www.amp-ohio.org/">American Municipal Power</a> has
        proposed building a new Meigs County coal plant, slated to begin
        construction late this year or in early 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following information provides background to explain why coal plants
        are at the center of a national debate over energy production and
        consumption.

      <h3>What’s the connection between coal and electricity?</h3>
      <p>
        Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity

          >comes from coal.</a

        Coal-fired power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to
        turn the turbines of an electrical generator.

        The U.S. has one of the largest coal reserves in the world and burns it

        If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some people
        concerned about building new coal-fired power plants?
      </h3>

        Coal plants

        In recent years, NASA climate scientist

          href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/james_e_hansen/index.html?scp=1-spot&sq=james%20hansen&st=cse"
          >James Hansen</a
        >
        has advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until technology
        is developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the
        atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hansen has
        <a href="http://www.alternet.org/environment/50795">warned</a> that
        continuing to release carbon dioxide at current rates – even just for
        the next 10 years – will create “a different planet – one without sea
        ice in the Arctic; with worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated
        with storms and a continuously rising sea level.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed American Municipal Power plant in Meigs County would
        release an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually,
        according to CARMA, a nonprofit group.

        Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs
        County?

        Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history. The

      <p>
        An experimental site for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology
        to store carbon dioxide underground, is under construction in West
        Virginia near Meigs County's southern border. In addition,
        <a
          href="http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/othercities/cincinnati/stories/2007/05/21/story7.html"
          >a coal-to-liquids facility and two other coal-fired power plants</a
        >
        have been proposed for the region, although at least some of those plans
        appear to be on hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the poorest counties in Ohio,
        according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a Meigs County resident
        who has organized opposition to the new plant, argues that poverty
        reduces local opposition to the coal industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When you have an economy that's entirely wrapped around coal, you can't
        speak out about it,” she says.

      <h3>
        Some Meigs County residents are concerned about the health effects of
        coal plants. Why?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In 2007, the four existing coal plants near Meigs County released
        millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, including arsenic, chromium,
        manganese, mercury, sulfuric acid aerosols and selenium, according to
        the Environmental Protection Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of these chemicals has been linked to human health problems, such
        as cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, impaired motor skills and
        neurological damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent Carson, a spokesperson for American Municipal Power, said the
        proposed plant will use new technology to control pollutants.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This will be the cleanest facility of its type in the state,” he said.

      <h3>
        Can it be proved that the coal plants are responsible for health
        problems in Meigs County?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It can be hard to prove that any one of the chemicals caused health
        problems of a particular individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We’re exposed to a soup of chemicals,” said Kevin Crist, director of
        the Center for Air Quality at Ohio University. Crist said health
        problems can be influenced by interactions between chemicals, as well as
        by lifestyle factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, low income – a common characteristic in Meigs County – is
        correlated with health problems. One reason is that poor people are more
        likely to smoke than their wealthier counterparts. More than

        >, compared to only about 25 percent of residents of other Ohio
        counties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crist said tall smokestacks on the existing plants probably disperse
        most pollutants away from Meigs County. But he said it is impossible to
        know for sure what residents are being exposed to, because no agency
        monitors the county’s air.

        estimated that the air quality at Southern Elementary School in Meigs
        County is worse than the air quality at 97 percent of the nation's
        schools. USA Today identified two of the coal plants near Meigs County
        as major contributors to pollution at the school.

        In addition, men in Meigs County have the lowest life expectancy among
        men in any Ohio county, according to

        Meigs County also has the highest death rate of any Ohio county for lung
        and bronchus cancer, according to the

      <h3>
        Despite the suspected health effects, wouldn’t a new plant create
        much-needed jobs?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Blue-collar labor is especially important in Meigs County, where fewer
        than 5 percent of adult residents hold college degrees and more than 25
        percent have no high school diploma, according to the Ohio Office of
        Policy, Research and Strategic Planning. In 2007, Meigs County's median
        income was $27,287, about half the national average.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Meigs County residents support the new plant for the jobs it may
        bring to the community. Construction worker Greg Sheets has testified in
        favor of the plant at public hearings.
      </p>
      <p>
        “My family will benefit by me going up there and working,” he said. “If
        I reached in your pocket and took $200,000 out of your pocket, would you
        like it?” he said, referring to the income he estimated he could earn
        during the four years it would take to build the plant.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no one can guarantee how many jobs will actually go to Meigs County
        residents or how much they will pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We all know that not all the workers are going to come from Meigs
        County,” said Sheets, the construction worker. “They’ll be from all over
        the country.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What’s next?</h3>
      <p>
        Before construction can begin on a new coal plant, an energy company
        must receive pollution permits from a state regulatory authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carson, the American Municipal Power spokesman, said his utility has
        received all the permits it needs and that construction on the plant
        will start in late 2009 or early 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opponents of the plant have appealed the plant’s permits. The state of
        Ohio will allow construction to proceed during the appeals process.
